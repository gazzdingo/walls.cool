# walls.cool

This Algorithmic art generator is to create and show an understanding that everyone is unique and not everyone has the same perseptions. 
Through the generated art I wanted to express the differences people have and create art to show that beauty is not perfection.

The project is built using Nodejs and Paperjs.
